Society for Biological Engineering at DTU (SBE.DTU) is a student organization by students, for students.
SBE.DTU’s primary objective is to integrate biology, engineering and innovation, while fostering
networking between students, universities and the life science industry.  
Our vision is to inspire students to be enthusiastic in their studies, to be ambitious, and to
think actively about their future career. In addition, by delivering passionate and resourceful students
to academia and industry, we help maintain Denmark’s strong position within biotechnology. 


The day-to-day work of our organisation is carried out by a board of 8 people – all voluntary and
unpaid. We are in charge of fulfilling the objective of our organisation by planning various events,
managing our economy and maintaining a solid social media presence.  
 Ultimately, SBE.DTU is nothing without its volunteers – the passion and determination of our
active members is what drives the organisation.
