### Reach and Discover
A yearly symposium where life science students can network their way to the next project or student job. More than 30 research groups, companies and organisations were represented last year.  

### Lecture sessions 
We regularly invite external professors and industry professionals to talk about current topics in biotechnology â€“ these are often subjects that the students do not encounter in their courses.  

### Company visits
We regularly visit both large and small biotech companies in Denmark. Examples of past visits are Evolva, Dupont and Chr. Hansen. 

### Bachelor start-up and Master start-up
Two separate yearly events that bring together the new BSc/MSc life science students just as the semester begins. We do this to encourage networking and foster friendships that hopefully last for the rest of the programme.
